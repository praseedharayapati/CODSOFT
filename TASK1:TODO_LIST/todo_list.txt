Here's a step-by-step guide to executing the To-Do List application code in PyCharm:

Step 1: Install PyCharm
If you don't have PyCharm installed on your computer, you can download it from the official website: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

Step 2: Create a New Project
Open PyCharm and create a new project by clicking on "Create New Project" or selecting "New Project" from the File menu.

Step 3: Choose Project Interpreter
In the New Project dialog, make sure you select an interpreter for your project. If you don't have Python installed on your computer, you can download and install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Step 4: Create a Python File
Once your project is created, right-click on the project name in the Project Explorer (usually on the left side of the PyCharm window) and select "New" > "Python File". Name the file as "todo_app.py".

Step 5: Copy the Code
Copy the entire code provided in the previous answer and paste it into the "todo_app.py" file.

Step 6: Install the Required Library
In order to use the `colorama` library, you need to install it. To do this, open the terminal in PyCharm and type the following command:

pip install colorama

Step 7: Run the Code
Now, you can run the To-Do List application by right-clicking on the "todo_app.py" file in the Project Explorer and selecting "Run 'todo_app'".

Step 8: Interact with the Application
The application will prompt you with a menu to choose options. You can follow the instructions and interact with the application using the command-line interface.
